####### Environment #######

Set the following environment variables:

HADOOP_HOME=<where you unzipped the hadoop tar ball>
HADOOP_BIN=<hadoo bin dir>
HADOOP_CONF_DIR=<hadoop conf dir>
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<protobuf pkgconfig dir>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<protobuf lib dir>

Mac/Linux example:
export HADOOP_HOME=/Users/perk387/Software/hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u6
export HADOOP_BIN=$HADOOP_HOME/bin
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=$HADOOP_HOME/conf
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/protobuf241/2.4.1/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/protobuf241/2.4.1/lib
